/**
 * visual-strategy.js — P1.4 PHASE B (2026-10-01): the Semantic Visual Strategy
 * schema + deterministic risk→strategy mapping + capability evidence.
 *
 * Operator-approved frame (PHASE A review):
 *   1. A strategy may change visual REPRESENTATION, never authored MEANING:
 *      action, subject, relation, state, world, metaphor stay byte-identical.
 *      This module only DECIDES and RECORDS — it never mutates a scene (that is
 *      PHASE C/D work, separately reviewed).
 *   2. UNKNOWN capability ≠ safe: LOW_CAPABILITY (<0.85) maps to
 *      SAFE_REPRESENTATION, but UNKNOWN maps to SAFE_REPRESENTATION only when
 *      the authored action is itself known-safe (measured confidence ≥ 0.85)
 *      AND the fallback representation has explicit renderer-lever evidence;
 *      otherwise UNRESOLVED.
 *   3. RELATION_LOCK requires relation EVIDENCE: an atom relation-bearing
 *      subject/object pair with a cast mapping. cast ≥ 2 alone never qualifies
 *      ("two people exist" ≠ "a relationship is shown").
 *   4. `_visualStrategy` is DECLARATIVE METADATA — the record of a decision.
 *      It is never a trusted flag: the firewall judges the SCENE and the
 *      contract evidence, not the strategy's self-description. Trust flow:
 *      atom → risk signals → strategy → representation → contract evidence →
 *      firewall.
 *
 * PHASE B review fixes (2026-10-01, conditional-approval items):
 *   a. levers ≠ measured evidence: SAFE_REPRESENTATION's lever DECLARATION is
 *      not evidence. UNKNOWN → SAFE additionally requires a fallback lever that
 *      is itself MEASURED ≥ 0.85 in the capability map (with the real map,
 *      illustration 0.800 / medium 0.845 do NOT qualify; diorama 0.938 /
 *      closeUp 0.917 do). No measured-safe fallback → UNRESOLVED.
 *   b. `cast:N` is a STRUCTURAL property, not a representation lever: it is
 *      excluded from the capability minimum and can never drag a scene into
 *      SAFE_REPRESENTATION by itself (it also stays out of relation evidence).
 *   c. mixed actions (PHASE B review 2): EVERY authored action must itself be
 *      known AND measured ≥ 0.85 — one unknown/unproven action poisons the
 *      set, so "walk known-safe + grabbing unknown" can never reach SAFE.
 *
 * Inputs come only from the measured P1.1–P1.3 systems: failure-taxonomy
 * classes, risk-selector features, and data/visual-capability.json. The
 * mapping is ONE table, deterministic, no LLM anywhere. Measured-only:
 * `decideStrategy` and `requirementFor` never mutate a scene and nothing
 * here feeds a gate — the ONLY mutation in this module is `resolveStrategy`'s
 * plan-tagged enum repair, which is applied by the planner, recorded in the
 * returned resolution, and enforced downstream by the firewall (PHASE D).
 *
 * PHASE D (2026-10-01, operator acceptance criteria D1–D4): the authored-action
 * lifecycle. `resolveStrategy()` validates every FINAL-scene action against the
 * renderer's own charAction enum and resolves schema-external actions by an
 * explicit, recorded decision — a plan-tagged repair to a measured enum action,
 * or a demand for authored proof (never a silent generic fallback). The
 * firewall consumes the recorded `resolution` via visualEvidence, never this
 * module's metadata.
