/**
 * flow.ts — FILM FLOW (2026-11-12): what the whole film knows, handed to every scene without threading props.
 *
 * `level` is config.meta.flow — 0 / absent for every film planned before Film Flow (it renders exactly as it did);
 * each slice that changes how a film MOVES is behind a level, so the same code renders the "before" and the "after"
 * of a passage (scripts/flow-passage.js --flow=<n>):
 *   1 — living characters: the narration drives mouth, head, brows and hand strokes; glances and weight shifts instead
 *       of sine loops; gestures with anticipation and overshoot (movements.ts livePose, speech.ts)
 * `base` = the film frame at which the enclosing <Sequence> starts, so a scene can ask "what is being said now".
